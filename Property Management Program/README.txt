Property Management Program
created by Aiden Park, Emmanuel Omari-Osei, Henrique Andras, and Mathew Pelletier


--- Summary ---

This program allows a user to view, list, and manage properties on an interactive online rental application. This system uses an SQL database to keep track of users, properties, messages, and other information. It also allows for landlords to keep track of renters' payments, and for managers to edit and update property information and listing fees.


--- How to Run ---

A jar file has been included, as well as the propertyManagement.sql database that the program uses. Once this database is hosted on a MySQL server, you should be able to run the program and use it's full functionality. If the database is not running correctly, you will not be able to create an account or log in. (Note: by default, the MySQL username is "User" and the password is "ensf480". If you would like to change this, you will have to change these values in DataBaseManager.java and recompile the program.)


--- How to Use ---

With the program running, you are free to explore it's functionality including:
- Creating accounts and logging in/out
- Viewing a list of active properties
- Sending a message to the landlord of a property
- Registering new properties as a landlord
- Paying the fee of a property as a landlord
- Searching for a specific property using criteria
- Changing property information and fees
- Setting up subscriptions to specific criteria, and being notified when a new property is posted that matches that criteria
- Viewing and changing information in the database as a manager
- Requesting a periodical summary report as a manager


--- What I Learned ---

For this project, I worked in a group with three other students to design and implement a fully functional property management program in 1 week. Over that time, I gained a lot of experience with SQL and databases, GUI, Java, Design Patterns, Object-Oriented Programming, and of course, working in a team!
