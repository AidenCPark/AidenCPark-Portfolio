In November 2017, I began volunteering as a webmaster for the Jumping Pound Ridge community, my local neighbourhood. Although I had limited knowledge of HTML and web design at the time, I took the challenge as a way to learn through experience and improve my skills. I was given some basic instructions by the council president as to how the website should look and what it should entail, but for the most part I was free to design it as I saw fit. Overall, I feel quite accomplished with what I was able to achieve at the time, and am happy to have had this opportunity.

Note: Since I have not been the owner of this website since June 2020, it seems that the community president has reverted to a free plan for hosting through Wix. This means some elements are no longer available, and that the website no longer has its own domain. Still, the majority of the website and its features are online and can be viewed at the link above.
